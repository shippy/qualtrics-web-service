## Example of a custom Qualtrics Web Service

This is a short proof of concept of a custom Qualtrics Web Service. It returns its results in a valid format that Qualtrics recognizes and saves as Embedded Data.

It is written in Sinatra and immediately deployable to Heroku. An instance is running at <https://salty-meadow-86558.herokuapp.com/>. Point your Web Service block in the Survey Flow to this URL and be treated to baroque pop in URI form.
